"P"	"21:01"	"What principle of warming does a fireplace exhibit? Conduction, convection, or radiation?"
"L"	"21:02"	"Librarian 'QP Backup Librarian [Librarian Name]' has joined the session."
"L"	"21:02"	"Hello"
"L"	"21:02"	"My name is [Librarian Name], and I'm a reference librarian with the QuestionPoint chat service. Our librarians staff this 24-hour service when your local librarians are unavailable."
"L"	"21:02"	"I'm reading your question right now to see how I can help you..."
"L"	"21:04"	"What subject area is this?"
"P"	"21:04"	"6th grade science"
"L"	"21:05"	"Here are definitions of the three principles"
"L"	"21:05"	"http://www.mansfieldct.org/schools/MMS/staff/hand/convcondrad.htm"
"P"	"21:07"	"Reading this, sounds like convection?"
"L"	"21:08"	"Yes, but what do you think of radiation?"
"P"	"21:09"	"I keep thinking of radiation as \"from the sun\" or somthing for cancer patients but then I think of \"radiant\" heat which I associate with a space heater?"
"L"	"21:09"	"This is a hard one"
"L"	"21:10"	"Yes, that is what I was thinking"
"L"	"21:10"	"There is a source of heat and it radiates its energy"
"P"	"21:11"	"The reason I am thinking convection is because it says \"actual movement of the warmed matter\"-not that th wood moves but it is the warmed matter?"
"L"	"21:12"	"Yes, I can see why that would be a good option too. The heated air flows in the room."
"P"	"21:13"	"If you were a 6th grader, which would you pick?"
"L"	"21:15"	"Iwould pick radation, but let me check further, ok?"
"P"	"21:15"	"That's great-should I stay online or do you want to email me?"
"L"	"21:16"	"How soon do you need the answer?"
"P"	"21:16"	"By 7 a.m. tomorrow (Wednesday)"
"P"	"21:17"	"If that's too soon we can just wing it-no pressure-I know you're probably close to quitting time."
"L"	"21:18"	"Give me a moment to search further."
"P"	"21:18"	"Ok, thanks"
"L"	"21:20"	"I found this pdf document on fireplaces and it explains that the initial and basic heat of a fireplace is radiation, then there are other elements that come into play"
"L"	"21:21"	"I will send you the page, its'at the bottom of pg1"
"L"	"21:21"	"http://www.cnr.uidaho.edu/extforest/WFS11.pdf"
"P"	"21:21"	"[Librarian Name]-thank you so much!!!"
"L"	"21:22"	"Is that enough information to get started?"
"P"	"21:23"	"Yes, that is great. I really appreciate your time and help-this is a great service. Thanks again and have a great night."
"L"	"21:23"	"Great!"
"L"	"21:24"	"You are welcome and have a good evening too"
"L"	"21:25"	"If you need additional assistance, please log back into the service"
"L"	"21:26"	"Librarian ended chat session."

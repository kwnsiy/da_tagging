"P"	"13:36"	"I am looking for the book Textbook of Rabbit Medicine by Frances HarcourtBrown and I do not see it at all on the website. Do you have any suggestions as to where I can get it?"
"L"	"13:36"	"A librarian will be with you in about a minute."
"L"	"13:37"	"[Librarian Name] - A librarian has joined the session."
"L"	"13:37"	"[Patron Name], welcome to [Name of chat service]! I'm looking at your question right now; it will be just a moment."
"P"	"13:37"	"Thanks."
"L"	"13:40"	"I don't see the book in either [Local] County Library or [Local] Library/State Resource Center; if you'll give me one moment, I'll see if it can be inter-library loaned from another library in the state."
"P"	"13:41"	"Thanks."
"L"	"13:44"	"Okay, I'm not seeing the textbook in any of the public libraries in [the state]."
"L"	"13:44"	"An institution like the [local university] might have it, however."
"P"	"13:45"	"If I'm not a student there would I be able to check it out?"
"L"	"13:45"	"I'm looking into that right now..."
"L"	"13:47"	"It looks like you can use the library, but unless you join one of two organizations you will not be able to check out the material."
"P"	"13:48"	"Hmm. I'm alumni at the [local college]. Would u be able to see if they have a copy?"
"L"	"13:48"	"Sure, one moment please."
"L"	"13:49"	"I don't see the item in their collection, unfortunately."
"P"	"13:50"	"Ok. Thanks for looking."
"L"	"13:50"	"I'm sorry I couldn't locate a copy for you."

"P"	"13:51"	"Can I make a suugestion abou the rabbit books you all do have?"
"L"	"13:51"	"Sure, what do you have in mind?"
"P"	"13:52"	"The libary needs to have adult books on rabbits. All I saw were things geared towards children."
"P"	"13:52"	"Just a thought."
"P"	"13:52"	"Thanks for your time."
"L"	"13:52"	"Have a good day."

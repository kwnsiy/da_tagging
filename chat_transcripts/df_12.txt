"L"	"11:17"	"Directors' names and enrollment numbers should be posted at their sites."
"P"	"11:17"	"No I haven't. I was hoping to find some online database with all that information in one place"
"L"	"11:17"	"Strategic goals might be found under the President's message/introduction."
"P"	"11:17"	"kind of like a University Book that can be picked up at a bookstore"
"L"	"11:18"	"There may be an online directory/database for this type of information."
"L"	"11:18"	"The other question would be whether the library provides access to the database."

"P"	"18:09"	"What age would you recommend reading Enid Blyton's boarding school books, St Clare's/ Malory Towers? I've a keen 7 yr-old who, I'm sure could cope with the language, but not sure about the content - aren't they just mean to each other all the time? Or can someone suggest a contemporary equivalent? Thanks."
"L"	"18:12"	"Librarian *librarian’s name+ has joined the session."
"L"	"18:12"	"Hi"
"L"	"18:13"	"Hi, I'm *Librarian’s name+ in California. I am helping out your librarians by answering questions for them right now. I'm reading what you wrote so I can help you..."
"L"	"18:13"	"interesting... I have not read these books :)"
"L"	"18:13"	"sounds like your 7 year old is ready for chapter books?"
"P"	"18:14"	"She reads Narnia, some of it goes over her head, I'm sure..."
"L"	"18:14"	"http://www.enidblyton.net/famous-five/ this page has short reviews of Blyton's books"
"L"	"18:15"	"The Boxcar Children or the Laura Ingles Wilder books may be right for her also."
"P"	"18:16"	"She loves Famous Five too. I suppose I'm after something more contemporary whilst keeping the escapist element - all ideas welcome - thanks for your ideas, I don't know th Boxcar Children."
"L"	"18:17"	"I see... let me see what else I can find. sounds like she's reading well above her age"
"L"	"18:18"	"Boxcar Children are by Gertrude Warner"
"P"	"18:18"	"She enjoys fairy/ballet stuff too - glittery covers etc :)"

"L"	"18:20"	"http://www.kidsreads.com/series/index.asp this list looks a bit better"
"P"	"18:21"	"I have a copy of Ballet Shoes somewhere, I'll dig it out - wow, thanks for all these lists - will look through them"

"L"	"18:23"	"next time you're in the library, talk to the children's librarian"

"L"	"18:23"	"will this help you get started today?"
"P"	"18:23"	"Really, thanks so much for this - what a fabulous resource. I just came across it tonight as I renewed a book online (at the Barbican Library in London) and there you are a library angel working all night. fab - over and out!"
